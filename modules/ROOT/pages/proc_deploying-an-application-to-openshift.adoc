= Deploying an application to OpenShift

=== Prerequisites

* You have installed link:proc_installing-pipelines-operator.html[OpenShift Pipelines] using the OpenShift Pipeline Operator listed in the OpenShift OperatorHub. Once installed, it is applicable to the entire cluster.
* You have installed the link:https://openshift.github.io/pipelines-docs/docs/docs/0.7/proc_installing_cli.html[Tekton CLI]
* You have installed link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned?intcmp=7013a000002CtetAAC[CodeReady Containers (CRC)] - a recommended solution for quick deployment of OpenShift clusters locally. For more information read the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.0/html/getting_started_guide/getting-started-with-codeready-containers_gsg[documentation for CRC].

=== Procedure

. Create a local CRC virtual machine:
+
----
$ crc start
----
+
NOTE: If you use a hosted hypervisor, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.0/html/getting_started_guide/getting-started-with-codeready-containers_gsg#starting-the-virtual-machine_gsg[CRC documentation].
+
`crc start` output contains user login and password needed for logging into the cluster.
+
. Add the cached `oc` binary to your PATH:

.. Run the crc oc-env command to print the command needed to add the cached oc binary to your PATH:
+
----
$ crc oc-env
----

.. Run the printed command.

. Log into the OpenShift cluster with the provided login and password:
+
----
$ oc login -u <login> -p <password> https://api.crc.testing:6443
----

. Create a project for the sample application:
+
----
$ oc new-project pipelines-tutorial
----

. Create the Kubernetes objects for deploying the PetClinic application on OpenShift:
+
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/pipelines-tutorial/master/petclinic/manifests.yaml
----

. Navigate to *Home* -> *Projects* -> *Status* in the OpenShift Web Console to verify the deployment. The deployment at this stage is not complete. The `Pipeline` you create in the next steps builds the container images for the PetClinic application and completes the deployment.
