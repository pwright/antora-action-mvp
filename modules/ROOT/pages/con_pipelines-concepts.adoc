The Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) provided by OpenShift Pipelines include: `Task`,`Pipeline`,`PipelineRun`, `TaskRun`, and `PipelineResource`.

* A `Task` is the smallest configurable unit in a `Pipeline` and is essentially a function of inputs and outputs that inform the `Pipeline` build. It can run individually or as a part of a `Pipeline`. A `Pipeline` includes one or more `Tasks`, with a `Task` consisting of one or more steps. Steps are a series of commands that are sequentially executed by the `Task`.

* A `Pipeline` is a series of `Tasks` that are executed to build complex workflows that automate the build, deployment and delivery of applications. It is a collection of `PipelineResources`,`Parameters`, and one or more `Tasks`. A `Pipeline` interacts with the outside world, by using `PipelineResources`, which are given to `Tasks` as inputs and outputs.

* A `PipelineRun` is used to run and manage the execution of the `Pipeline`. `PipelineRun` initiates the creation of a `TaskRun` for each `Task` being executed in the `Pipeline`.

* `TaskRun` is auto-created by a `PipelineRun` for each `Task` in a `Pipeline` and  results from running an instance of a `Task`. It can also be manually created if a `Task` runs outside of a `Pipeline`.

* A `PipelineResource` is an object that is used as an input and output for pipeline `Tasks`. For example, if an input is a Git repository and an output is a container image built from that Git repository, these are both classified as `PipelineResources`. `PipelineResources` currently support Git Resources, Image Resources, Cluster Resources, and Storage Resources.
