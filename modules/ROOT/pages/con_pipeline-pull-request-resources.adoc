= Pull Request resource

A Pull Request resource represents a pull request event from a source control system. Adding the Pull Request resource as an input to a `Task` populates the workspace with a set of files containing generic pull request related metadata such as base/head commit, comments, and labels.

Adding the Pull Request resource as an output of a `Task` updates the source control system.
