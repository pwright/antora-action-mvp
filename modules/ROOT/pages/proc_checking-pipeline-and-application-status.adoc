= Checking pipeline and application status

You can examine the logs for `PipelineRuns` to verify its status.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. Check the `PipelineRun` logs as it runs using the `tkn pipeline logs` command, which interactively allows you to chose the required pipelinerun and inspect the logs:
+
----
$ tkn pipeline logs -f
? Select pipeline : petclinic-deploy-pipeline
? Select pipelinerun : petclinic-deploy-pipeline-run-tsv92 started 39 seconds ago

...
[build : nop] Build successful
[deploy : build-step-oc] deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/spring-petclinic rolled out
[deploy : nop] Build successful
----

. Check the *Project Status* in the OpenShift Web Console to verify that the PetClinic image is successfully built and deployed.

. To rerun the last pipelinerun, using the same pipeline resources and service account used in the previous pipeline, use:
+
----
tkn pipeline start petclinic-deploy-pipeline --last
----
