= Working with Pipelines using the OpenShift Developer Perspective

After you create Pipelines using the `tkn` CLI or YAML files. You can visually interact with your deployed Pipelines on the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/web-console/odc-about-developer-perspective.html[Developer Perspective] of the Openshift web console.

The *Pipelines* view in the Developer perspective lists all the pipelines in a project; the last run of the pipeline, itâ€™s status, and the time taken for the run; and the status of the individual tasks in a pipeline run.

=== Prerequisites

To view your pipelines in the *Pipelines* view and interact with them, ensure that:

* You have access to an OpenShift Cluster and have logged in to the web console and are in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/web-console/odc-about-developer-perspective.html[Developer perspective].
* You have cluster administrator privileges to install operators and have link:https://openshift.github.io/pipelines-docs/docs/docs/assembly_installing-pipelines.html[installed the OpenShift Pipelines Operator].
* You have created a project, link:https://openshift.github.io/pipelines-docs/docs/docs/0.7/assembly_using-pipelines.html[deployed an application, and created a pipeline] for the application.

=== Procedure

To visually interact  with the pipelines in your project:

. In the *Pipelines* view of the Developer Perspective, select the project you created from the *Project* drop-down to see the pipelines listed in the *Pipelines* page.

. Click:
.. *Pipeline Runs* tab to see the completed, running, or failed runs for the pipeline.
.. *Parameters* tab to see the parameters defined in the Pipeline and add or edit additional parameters as required.
.. *Resources* tab to see the resources defined in the Pipeline and add or edit additional resources as required.

. Click *Actions* on the top-right corner and select *Start* to see the *Start Pipeline* dialog box. The resources populated in the *Start Pipeline* dialog box are based on the pipeline definition.
. Use the drop-downs in the *Start Pipeline* dialog box to select or create the required resources to customize them as required, and click *Start* to start the pipeline run.
. The *Pipeline Run Details* page displays the pipeline being executed. You can:

* Hover over the tasks to see the time taken for each task execution.
* Click on a task to see logs for that particular task.
* Click the *Logs* tab to see the logs as per the execution sequence of the tasks.

. Click *Pipelines Runs* in the breadcrumb trail displayed at the top-left corner to see a list of pipeline runs for the pipeline in the *Pipeline Runs* page.

* Use the filters to see the complete, running, or failed pipeline runs.
* Use the *Options* menu adjacent to a pipeline run to stop a running pipeline, rerun a pipeline using the same parameters and resources as that of the previous pipeline execution, or delete a pipeline run.
