= Defining and creating pipeline tasks

`Tasks` are the building blocks of a `Pipeline` and consist of sequentially executed steps. `steps` are a series of commands that achieve a specific goal, for example, build an image.

Every `Task` runs as a pod and each `step` runs in its own container within the same pod. Since they run within the same pod they have access to the same volumes to cache files, configmaps, and secrets. They use `inputs` parameters, for example, a git , and `outputs` parameters, for example, an image in a registry, to interact with other tasks.

`Tasks` are reusable and can be used in multiple `Pipeline` s. For this tutorial, you create a Maven `Task` with a single step to build a Maven based application, and then add two reusable `Tasks` from the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog[catalog] repository.

=== Procedure

. To create the Maven `Task`:

.. Copy the contents of the following sample `Task` YAML file and save it:
+
----
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: maven-build
spec:
  inputs:
    resources:
    - name: workspace-git
      targetPath: /
      type: git
  steps:
  - name: build
    image: maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim
    command:
    - /usr/bin/mvn
    args:
    - install

----
+
This `Task` starts a pod and runs a container inside that pod using the `maven:3.6.0-jdk-8-slim` image to run the specified commands. It receives an input directory called `workspace-git` which contains the source code of the application.
+
Only the requirement for a git repository is declared on the `Task` and not a specific git repository to be used. This allows `Tasks` to be reusable for multiple `Pipeline` s and purposes.

.. Create the `Task` within your project:
+
----
oc create -f maven-build-task.yaml
----

. Install the `s2i-java` and `openshift-client` reusable `Tasks` from the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog[catalog repository], which contains a list of reusable `Tasks` for `Pipeline` s:
+
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/tektoncd-catalog/release-v0.7/openshift-client/openshift-client-task.yaml
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/pipelines-catalog/release-v0.7/s2i-java-8/s2i-java-8-task.yaml
----

. Verify the `Tasks` added to the `Pipeline` as follows:
+
----
$ tkn task ls

NAME              AGE
maven-build       23 secs ago
openshift-client  10 secs ago
s2i-java          11 secs ago
