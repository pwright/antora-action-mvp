= Installing the Pipelines Operator

OpenShift Pipelines can be installed by using the operator listed in the OpenShift OperatorHub. When you install the pipelines operator, the custom resources required for the pipeline configuration are automatically installed along with the operator.

. In the *Create Operator Subscription* screen, ensure that:

  * the *Installation Mode* selected is *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*, as the OpenShift Pipelines operator needs to watch for Tekton Custom Resources across all namespaces.
  * the *Approval Strategy* is *Automatic* so that future upgrades to the operator are handled automatically by the the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). If you select *Manual*; when a new version of the Operator is available, you will need to manually approve the OLM update request to update to the new version.
